Implement the spectral clustering algorithm that uses the sign of the components of the eigenvector corresponding to the second 
smallest eigenvalue for clustering. Use the following weight function such as the image above.
This application is the clustering algorithm to the 2-dimension data provided in the file “SpectData.txt” with the goal of 
identifying two clusters corresponding to two concentric circles. Each row in the file corresponds to one data point.
<ul>
<li>A plot of the points provided in the dataset after clustering showing the two identified clusters using σ = 0.01. plot Name “Spect_01.jpg”.</li>  
<li>A plot of the points provided in the dataset after clustering showing the two identified clusters using σ = 0.05. plot Name “Spect_05.jpg”.</li> 
<li>A plot of the points provided in the dataset after clustering showing the two identified clusters using σ = 0.1. plot Name “Spect_1.jpg”.</li>
</ul>
